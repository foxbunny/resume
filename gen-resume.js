<!--
Thank you for taking the time to review the source code of this r√©sum√©.

Although it may sound silly for a r√©sum√©, I have cut no corners. This is the
best code I can write given the requirements listed further below, and this is
how I write actual applications in real-life (except for the changes made
specifically here to keep the page self-contained, noted below). Contrary to
common belief, this way of writing applications has given me the most
flexibility and performance relative to the more prevalent approaches, and I 
can complete applications of much bigger scope, much faster this way. This 
therefore also a scalable approach. If you're curious, I could talk about it 
all day. :)

Here's some notes I jotted down while creating this page.

Requirements:

- I want the r√©sum√© to be completely self-contained.
- I want the page to load in the browser without any special tools.
- I want the r√©sum√© to work regardless of what the browser supports: with or
  without CSS, with or without JavaScript, etc.
- I want the r√©sum√© to be accessible to screen readers.
- I want the r√©sum√© to be printable.
- I want the r√©sum√© to be interactive so that it can offer different
  pre-analyzed views of the information.

Notes:

- A simple NodeJS script generates all of the HTMl to avoid repetition.
- Images, CSS and JavaScript are all embedded. There are no links to external
  resources so the page can work offline or in environments where network
  connectivity is restricted. Normally these would all be external and either
  linked to from the CSS file or in the HEAD tag with appropriate media (CSS)
  and defer (JS) attributes.
- The HTML was coded first without any consideration for appearance, then read
  by the screen reader, and then the CSS and JavaScript were applied after the
  fact.
- The stylesheet is divided into distinct sections for screen and print media.
  This would normally be achieved using two CSS files, where both would have a
  media attribute on the LINK tags, but this page needed to be self-contained
  for convenience, so we use media queries instead.
- Support for older browsers is not taken into account.
- Support for Safari-based browser is not specifically tested, though it should
  work.
- Portions of the page are generated statically using the scripts.

      <h2 id="overview-heading">Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Hajime is a all-rounder front end developer with technical leadership
        experience. He has deep knowledge of everything that goes into creating
        user-facing application interfaces, from the foundational web
        technologies to UX design, to development workflows, to introducing
        the technology to new developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        When leading teams, Hajime seeks to establish a fair, trust-first,
        share-everything environment, where psychological safety of the team
        members takes precedence over everything else. Experience has shown
        that this approach boosts the team performance compared to other
        approaches that are more commonly in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the past several years, Hajime's main focus has been on simplicity
        and efficiency, both in technical terms as well as in terms of workflows
        and processes for successful teamwork.
